# Mindf@\*k Keyboard
Typing is hard. We all know how difficult it is at times to press the *right*
keys in the *right* combinations at the *right* times. It's a skill and it
takes a lot of effort and coordination to do it effectively.

That's why we made it harder.

## What is this?
This is a terrible soft-keyboard for Android devices, written in 8 hours for
[Terrible Hack Waterloo](http://terriblehack.website). On every keypress, the
the keyboard layout is randomized to make typing just so much more *fun*.

Submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/terriblekeyboard).

## IT'S NOT A BUG IT'S A FEATURE!!!1
When using this thing, you might notice that as you type, you wind up with
fewer and fewer available keys. This is because we are abusing Android... and
*Java sucks*.

Don't worry though, this software is supposed to absolutely useless! :grinning:

## Requirements
This awful keyboard requires a minimum of Android 4.3 (API 18).

You need either (a) a working Android device on 4.3+ or (b) the Android
emulator on an appropriate desktop system.

It is also probably a good idea not to have this app installed as the *only*
keyboard on your system.

## Caveats
If you need to reset the key layout to the default QWERTY (sorry DVORAK geeks!)
then you will need to temporarily change input methods to a different keyboard,
then change back.
